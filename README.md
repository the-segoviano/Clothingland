This is a technical test for the open position of iOS developer for the company The Agile Monkeys.

In this app example, I show the way (my way) for request services from an API, parse a JSON response and give some interaction with the user.

This example was built in Swift 5.x with a minimum version of iOS 12. And also was built with native elements of the iOS environment.

The architecture selected for the development was MVC by Apple.
